## Demo
![A demo gif should be here and not this text](source/SATextFieldDemo/docs/preview.gif)

## Installation
The easiest way to install and use is simply to include **SATextField.swift** into your project's "Compiled Sources" build phase.

The project is set up as a shared framework (SATextField) to enable [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) support if you don't care about taking on that complexity.

Alternatively, this can easily be added as a git submodule into your project.
